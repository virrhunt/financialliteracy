<p style="text-align: center; margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px">While our research covers trends from the past few years, the recent election of Donald J. Trump will surely shake up our current economic climate. Experts predict consumer behavior will reflect in the stock market through the changes Trump plans to implement. The expected fiscally conservative turn, which could see less government regulation and lower taxes. Trumpâ€™s proposed tariffs of up to 60% is intended to boost American corporate growth and encourage growth in American companies. Trump is also expected to continue his efforts of making tax breaks (most beneficial for the wealthy).

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"> The graph above compares the total global asset growth of <span class="tooltip">
    mutual funds
    <span class="tooltiptext"> a professionally managed investment company that pools money from many investors to purchase a variety of securities, such as stocks, bonds, and short-term debt</span></span>
    and exchange-traded funds over a period between 1998 and 2023. Though the two investments are very similar, the chart demonstrates the recent growth of popularity in  <span class="tooltip">
    ETFs,
    <span class="tooltiptext"> A pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like an individual stock</span></span>
    which differ from mutual funds in their trading window and management style. While mutual funds can only be traded once day after the markets close, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day, similar to regular stocks. Over the past 20 years, both types of investments have seen significant growth due their associations with low 
    <span class="tooltip">
    risk
    <span class="tooltiptext"> possibility of losing money or experiencing a financial loss due to a variety of factors </span></span>
    and 
    <span class="tooltip">
        diversification,
        <span class="tooltiptext"> practice of spreading investments across different asset classes, industries, and regions to reduce risk and volatility </span></span>
<br>
<br>
With the astronomical rise in popularity of both mutual funds and ETFs, it can be worrying to consider how Trumpâ€™s presidency, along with his tariff and trade agendas,  could affect your investments and overall financial life. According to projections from T. Rowe Price, U.S. 
<span class="tooltip">
    small-cap stocks
    <span class="tooltiptext">shares of a public company with a market capitalizationâ€”total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stockâ€”between $250 million and $2 billion </span></span>
could potentially benefit from Trumpâ€™s win if he laxes market regulation and takes a softer position on mergers and acquisitions. Investors are also looking closely at Trumpâ€™s immigration policies, which could drive further inflation and push bond yields up. Lastly, if you hold any mutual fund investments in the energy sector, Trumpâ€™s plans to slow spending and investment in renewable sources could shake up your portfolio. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"> The graphic above visualizes three measures of the <span class="tooltip">
    consumer price index (CPI)
    <span class="tooltiptext">Measures change over time in prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services</span>
    </span> between January of 2022 and October of 2024, relative to the base year of 1999.
    <br>
    <br>
    The measurement of the base year, though not illustrated, is 100 (notably, CPI measurements do not contain units).  
    The indices our graphic visualizes include: a representative basket for all items in U.S. city averages; a representative basket for services in U.S. city averages; and a representative basket for commodities in U.S. city averages. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Should we analyze the line visualizing commodities in U.S. city averages, the bottom-most point indicates the prices consumers paid in Jan. â€˜22 increased by 32.15 percentage points relative to 1999. Notably, CPI measurement for both services in U.S. city averages and all items in U.S. city averages increased between Jan. â€˜23 and Oct. â€˜24, whereas commodities in U.S. city averages decreased between Jan. â€˜23 and Oct. â€˜24.
    <br>
    <br> 
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px"><b> So, what now?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
The CPI, a measure of inflation, and growth of mutual funds and ETFs are often inversely related, as a decrease in inflation, apparent in the negative slope of our indexes, would induce positive growth in mutual funds and ETFs. Essentially, interest and inflation rates fall simultaneously, thereby encouraging investments. Itâ€™s difficult to ascertain how Trumponomics will impact our economy just yet, however, experts have noted Trumpâ€™s tariffs and trade agenda may bring about a second wave of inflation.  </p>
