    Some quick terms to know before we start...

<ul style="text-align: center; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">
    <li> <b>stocks</b> = a stock, also known as equity, is a security that represents a particular fraction of ownership in a company</li>
    <li>  <b>cryptocurrency</b> = an encrypted decentralized digital currency. Transactions are recorded on the Blockchain, a coded ledger of exchanges (Most popular types: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, BNB)</li>
    <li> <b>bonds</b> = a fixed income investment where individuals lend money to a government or company at a certain interest rate for an amount of time;
        the government or company then repays lenders with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond

    <li>
        <b>CD (certificate of deposit)</b> = a type of savings account where you agree to leave your money in the bank for a set amount of time and earn a fixed interest rate.

    ETFs,
    <span class="tooltiptext"> A pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like an individual stock</span></span>
    which differ from mutual funds in their trading window and management style. While mutual funds can only be traded once day after the markets close, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day, similar to regular stocks. Over the past 20 years, both types of investments have seen significant growth due their associations with low

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"> The graphic above visualizes three measures of the <span class="tooltip">
    consumer price index (CPI)
    <span class="tooltiptext">Measures change over time in prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services</span>
    </span> between January of 2022 and October of 2024, relative to the base year of 1999.
    <br>
    <br>
    The measurement of the base year, though not illustrated, is 100 (notably, CPI measurements do not contain units).  
    The indices our graphic visualizes include: a representative basket for all items in U.S. city averages; a representative basket for services in U.S. city averages; and a representative basket for commodities in U.S. city averages. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Should we analyze the line visualizing commodities in U.S. city averages, the bottom-most point indicates the prices consumers paid in Jan. â€˜22 increased by 32.15 percentage points relative to 1999. Notably, CPI measurement for both services in U.S. city averages and all items in U.S. city averages increased between Jan. â€˜23 and Oct. â€˜24, whereas commodities in U.S. city averages decreased between Jan. â€˜23 and Oct. â€˜24. </p>
